## About The Project


### Description

Nine Casino is a mobile version of a gambling site that is popular in Canada.  

This casino already had a working web version at the time of the creation of the mobile application. Initially, it was not planned to create a mobile application, so there was no documentation on the backend and frontend, and we had to, focusing on the site, collect the whole picture in small pieces, which was quite challenging.

## Functionality


In fact, I can't emphasize any specific functionality.  
The work mainly consisted in the competent formation of the request, receiving data and displaying it; connecting various services such as billing and so on.

I am very glad that on this project we used the *MVVM* architecture together with the *rxswift* library. This was my first experience using *reactive* programming, and I think I understood the basics of it.

But in order not to be completely empty here, I want to show a beautiful custom interactive present:
